-Test-Why.pillar 
- Test-why2.pillar -> Tests-1-101.pillar
 	Revised the logic because it was strange
- Test-why done a pass 
	split it and removing the bastract stuff I could not understand and it was boring,
- Test TDD (may be remove some duplication with 101)
- Test-XTDD (should redo when P9 is out)

Please Guille have a look because I'm sure you get ideas!
