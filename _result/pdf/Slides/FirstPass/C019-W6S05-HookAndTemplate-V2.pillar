${slide:title=Remember...}$

- A message send leads to a choice
- A class hierarchy defines the choices
- Code can be reused and refined in subclasses
- Sending a message in a class defines a hook:
-- i.e., a place where subclasses can inject variations

${slide:title=The Template Method}$


- a template method specifies a skeleton
- the skeleton has hooks, i.e., places to be customized
-- hooks may or may not have a default behavior

   | title |
   title := self class name.

      nextPutAll: (title first isVowel ifTrue: [ 'an ' ] ifFalse: [ 'a ' ]);

${slide:title=Another Template Method: Object Copy}$

- Copying objects is complex:
-- graph of connected objects
-- cycles
-- each class may want a different copy strategy
- Simple solution for simple cases: ==copy==/==postCopy==

${slide:title=Object Copy}$

[[[
Object >> copy
  "Answer another instance just like the receiver. Subclasses typically override postCopy. Copy is a template method in the sense of Design Patterns. So do not override it. Override postCopy instead. Pay attention that normally you should call postCopy of your superclass too."
    ^ self shallowCopy postCopy
]]]

[[[
Object >> shallowCopy
  "Answer a copy of the receiver which shares the receiver's instance variables. Subclasses that need to specialize the copy should specialize the postCopy hook method."
  <primitive: 148>
  ...
]]]

${slide:title=Default hook}$

[[[
Object >> postCopy
  "I'm a hook method in the sense of Design Patterns TemplateHook/Methods. I'm called by copy. self is a shallow copy, subclasses should copy fields as necessary to complete the full copy"
  ^ self
]]]

${slide:title=postCopy: Refinement}$

[[[
Collection subclass: #Bag
   instanceVariableNames: 'contents'
   classVariableNames: ''
   package: 'Collections-Unordered'
]]]

[[[
Bag >> postCopy
   super postCopy.
   contents := contents copy
]]]

- ==contents== is a ==Dictionary==
- ==postCopy== recursively invoke copy on dictionary

${slide:title=Dictionary >> postCopy: Deeper copy}$

[[[
Dictionary >> postCopy
   "Must copy the associations, or later store will affect both the original and the copy"
   array := array 
               collect: [ :association |
                          association ifNotNil: [ association copy ] ]
]]]

${slide:title=Conclusion}$

- Template Method is a very common design pattern
- Sending a message defines a hook
- Sending a message increases potential reuse
