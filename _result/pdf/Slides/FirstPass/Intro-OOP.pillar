- Object-oriented programming 
- Objects and classes

${slide:title=Programming is modelling}$

- There is not one single model of the world
- There are multiple ways to capture a model of the world

${slide:title=Object-Orientation}$

- Is a paradigm, not a technology
- Reflects, simulates the real world
- Thinks in terms of organization
- Tries to
-- handle complexity
-- enhance reusability
-- minimize maintenance cost

${slide:title=Evolution}$

- Procedures
- Structured Programming
- Fourth Generation Languages
- Object-Oriented-Programming
- (Aspect-Oriented Programming) is more a variation of OOP

${slide:title=Traditional Point of View}$

- Focuses upon procedures
- Functionality is vested in procedures
- Data exists solely to be operated upon by procedures
- Procedures know about the structure of data
- Requires large number of procedures and procedure names

${slide:title=Let us compare}$

Problem: compute the total area of a set of geometric shapes

[[[
myPicture := Picture new.
myPicture add: (Square x: 3 y: 3 width: 3).
myPicture add: (Rectangle x: 5 y: with:5 height: 3)
myPicture add: (Circle x: 12 y: 3 radius: 3).

	double total = 0;

	       switch (shape.kind()) {
	       case SQUARE:
	           Square square = (Square) shape;
	           total += square.width * square.width; break;
	       case RECTANGLE:
	           Rectangle rectangle = (Rectangle) shape;
	           total += rectangle.width * rectangle.height; break;
	       case CIRCLE:
	           Circle circle = (Circle) shape;
	           total += java.lang.Math.PI * circle.radius * circle.radius / 2; break;

	    return total; }

	total := 0.
	self shapes do [:aShape |
	   total := total + aShape area ].
	^ total

 ^ aShape width * aShape width

Rectangle >> area

Circle >> area

${slide:title=What is OOP?}$

- An application is a collection of interacting entities (objects)
- Objects are characterized by behavior and state
- Inter-object behavior needs to be coordinated
- Inter-object communication is the key to coordination

${slide:title=What is OOP?: Encapsulation/Composition}$

- ""Encapsulation"" 
Hide and control the internal representation of an object. This will ease further evolution. 

- ""Composition"" 
An object can be composed of several simpler other objects. 

${slide:title=What is OOP?: Message passing}$

- ""Distribution of responsibility and delegation"" 
Computing a problem is the results of many objects performing (sub) tasks.

- ""Late binding and message passing"" 
The receiver of a message determines which method will be executed on it. 
-- what? the message 
-- how? the method 

- ""Inheritance"" 
We define abstractions as conceptual hierarchies and reuse implementation in subclasses 

- ""Polymorphism"" 
Objects exhibiting the same interface can be substitued and class hierarchy defines families of polymorphic objects

%${slide:title=Vocabulary point}$
%- Encapsulation means that related entities are bundled together, for example, a Shape object encapsulates data and related operations for shapes.
%- Abstraction means that we ignore irrelevant details, for example, we abstract from the details of a Shape object and just use its interface (i.e., its operations).
%- Information hiding means that we hide (forbid access to) the representation behind an abstraction, for example, you may not directly access the state of a Shape but must access it only through its interface.




${slide:title=Object-Oriented Viewpoint}$

- An application is a set of objects interacting by sending messages
- The functionality of an object is described by its methods, its data are stored in private variables
- An objectâ€™s functionality can be invoked by sending a message
- Everything is an object


${slide:title=Responsibility-Driven Design}$

- Objects are responsible to maintain information and provide services
- A good design exhibits:
-- high cohesion of operations and data within classes 
-- low coupling between classes and subsystems
Every method should perform one, well-defined task:
-- High level of abstraction
-- Write to an interface, not an implementation







${slide:title=State \+ Behavior \+ Identity}$

+>file://figures/StateBehaviorIdentity.jpg|width=80+

${slide:title=State \+ Behavior \+ Identity}$

;State
:Objects it contains or refers to (ex: point location)
;Behavior
:an object understands a given set of messages
;Identity
:an object can be the same (of the same class) than another one but it has still a different identity (location in memory)

${slide:title=Equality and Identity}$

I want to eat the pizza that you are eating
;Equality
:I want to eat the ""same"" kind of pizza
;Identity
:I eat your pizza

${slide:title=Data/Messages/Methods}$

+>file://figures/EncapsulationWithMessages.png|width=52+

${slide:title=What vs. How}$

;What: Messages
:Specify what behavior objects are to perform
:Details of how are left up to the receiver
:State information only accessed via messages
;How: Methods
:Specify how operation is to be performed
:Must have access to (contain or be passed) data
:Need detailed knowledge of data
:Can manipulate data directly

+>file://figures/EncapsulationWithMessages.png|width=30+

${slide:title=Message}$

-Sent to receiver object: receiver-object message
-A message may include parameters necessary for performing the action
-In Smalltalk, a message-send always returns a result (an object)
-Only way to communicate with an object and have it perform actions

+>file://figures/EncapsulationWithMessages-message.png|width=75+

${slide:title=Method}$

-Defines how to respond to a message
-Selected via method lookup technique
-Has name that is the same as message name
-Is a sequence of executable statements
-Returns an object as result of execution

+>file://figures/EncapsulationWithMessages-method.png|width=100+

${slide:title=Object Encapsulation}$

-Technique for
--Creating objects with encapsulated state/behaviour
--Hiding implementation details
--Protecting the state information of objects
--Communicating/accessing via a uniform interface
-Puts objects in control
-Facilitates modularity, code reuse and maintenance
--External perspective  vs. Internal perspective
--What vs. How
--Message vs. Method
