${slide:title=Remember: A Block Definition Freezes its Body}$

- Evaluating a block definition does ""not"" execute its body 
[[[
[ 2 + 6 ] 
> [ 2 + 6 ] 
]]]

${slide:title=Remember: Block Execution}$

- Executing a Block is explicit 

[[[
[ 2 + 6 ] value
> 8 
]]]

- and repeatable

[[[
| b |
b := [ 2 + 6 ].
b value.
> 8
b value
> 8 
]]]

${slide:title=Blocks are Used to Express Conditions}$

[[[
max: anObject 
  "Answer the receiver or the argument, whichever has the greater anObject."

  ^ self > anObject
      ifTrue: [ self ]
      ifFalse: [ anObject ]
]]]

Yes this is a message ==ifTrue:ifFalse:== sent to a Boolean


${slide:title=Blocks are Used to Express Loops}$

- Some simple loops
- Printing 10 dots

[[[
10 timesRepeat: [ File stdout << '.' ]
> ............
]]]


${slide:title=Blocks are Used to Express Loops (2)}$

[[[language=smalltalk
1 to: 10 do: [:i | File stdout << i ]
> 12345678910 
]]]

${slide:title=Blocks are Used to Express Loops (3)}$

- A traditional ==for== loop for i=1,100, i++

[[[
1 to: 100 by: 3 do: [:i | File stdout << i ]
> 147101316192225283134374043464952555861646
> 770737679828588919497100
]]]

- The message ==to:by:do:== is sent to an integer
- ==i== will get all the computed values one by one


${slide:title=Blocks are Used For Iterators}$

- Basis for iterators

[[[
#(2 4 5 -4 3 -2) collect: [ :each | each abs ]
> #(2 4 5 4 3 2)
]]]

- Here the message is sent to the collection itself
- See Lecture on Iterators

${slide:title=Yes ifTrue\:ifFalse\: is a message!}$

[[[
Weather isRaining
    ifTrue: [ self takeMyUmbrella ]
    ifFalse: [ self takeMySunglasses ]
]]]

- Conceptually ==ifTrue:ifFalse:== is a message sent to an object: a boolean!
- ==ifTrue:ifFalse:== is in fact radically optimized by the compiler


${slide:title=Implementation Note}$

- Note that the Virtual Machine shortcuts calls to Boolean such as condition for speed reason
- But you can implement your own conditional methods and debug to see that sending a message is dispatching to the right object
- Implement your own control structure such as ==siAlors:sinon:== (in French) and try it

${slide:title=Summary}$

- Blocks freeze and control computation 
- Basis for 
-- conditionals 
-- loops / iterators
-- exceptions (see future lectures)
-- concurrence
