!! Decorators

- Encapsulate state and behavior

- Enforce API


!! The case of Stream


!! Limits 

- All the decorators should have the same API and delegate

- Should be thought as a whole

- To add a new API, we can add a generic forwarder on the top of the hierarchy

[[[
	RootDecorator >> newAPI
		^ decoratee newAPI

]]]


!! The case of Commander
